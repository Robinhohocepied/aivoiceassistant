# Phase 10 — Performance & Reliability

Status: [ ] Not Started · Owner: TBC · Target: TBC

Goals
- Meet response time targets and ensure graceful degradation.

Tasks
- [ ] Achieve ≤5s median response time
- [ ] Add retries with exponential backoff for external calls
- [ ] Use idempotency keys for message send and event creation
- [ ] Fallback to human on repeated failures with context
- [ ] Load test typical flows; document capacity

Deliverables
- Performance report and reliability patterns in place

Acceptance Criteria
- Meets FRD performance target; documented failover paths

Metrics
- P50/P95 latency; error rates; successful retries

Dependencies
- Phases 2–5
