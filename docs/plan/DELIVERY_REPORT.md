# Delivery Report — Phase 1 (Foundations)

Date: 2025-10-16
Owner: Engineering
Status: Completed (pending ADR-0001 stakeholder sign-off)

Summary
- Implemented Phase 1 scaffolding: FastAPI service, health endpoint, config loader, structured logging with correlation IDs and PII redaction, unit test, and CI lint/test workflow stub.

What’s Delivered
- Service skeleton
  - `app/main.py`: FastAPI app with `GET /healthz` returning status, version, commit, env, time.
  - `app/config.py`: Env-based config loader with `.env` support.
  - `app/logging.py`: JSON logging, request correlation middleware, PII masking.
- Repo structure
  - `agents/`, `connectors/`, `jobs/` directories seeded for later phases.
- Developer UX
  - `.env.example` with all documented variables.
  - `README.md` with run/lint/test instructions.
  - `requirements.txt` for quick setup.
  - `ruff.toml` base lint config and `.gitignore`.
- Quality gates (CI stub)
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run ruff and pytest on PRs.
- Tests
  - `tests/test_health.py` validates 200 OK and payload shape.

How to Run Locally
- Create `.env` from `.env.example` and set values if needed.
- Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Start: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080`.
- Health check: `curl -s http://localhost:8080/healthz | jq`.
- Lint: `ruff check .` · Test: `pytest -q`.

Acceptance Criteria Check
- Service boots without errors: Yes (local run via uvicorn).
- `GET /healthz` returns 200 < 100ms: Endpoint implemented; performance acceptable in local tests.
- Lint/test jobs pass in CI: Workflow defined; depends on project CI runner.

Notes & Assumptions
- ADR-0001 (tech stack) remains Proposed; stakeholder sign-off pending.
- Redaction masks common email/phone patterns in logs; extend as needed.
- Build metadata `APP_VERSION` and `GIT_SHA` are read from env when present.

Next Steps (Phase 2+)
- Phase 2: Add WhatsApp webhook verification and inbound/outbound handlers.
- Phase 3: Implement French NLU flow with session state and guardrails.
- Phase 4: Integrate Google Calendar for availability and booking.
