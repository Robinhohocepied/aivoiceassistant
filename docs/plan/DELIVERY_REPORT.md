# Delivery Report — Phase 1 (Foundations)

Date: 2025-10-16
Owner: Engineering
Status: Completed (pending ADR-0001 stakeholder sign-off)

Summary
- Implemented Phase 1 scaffolding: FastAPI service, health endpoint, config loader, structured logging with correlation IDs and PII redaction, unit tests.
- Added developer ergonomics: Makefile (venv-aware `make start`), Dockerfile, `.env.example`, and local ngrok guide for webhooks.

What’s Delivered
- Service skeleton
  - `app/main.py`: FastAPI app with `GET /healthz` returning status, version, commit, env, time. Uses FastAPI lifespan for startup/shutdown logs.
  - `app/config.py`: Env-based config loader with `.env` support.
  - `app/logging.py`: JSON logging with correlation IDs, PII masking, and structured extras.
- Repo structure
  - `agents/`, `connectors/`, `jobs/` directories seeded for later phases.
- Developer UX
  - `.env.example` with all documented variables.
  - `Makefile` with `make start/run/test/lint`, venv creation, and ngrok QA helpers.
  - `Dockerfile` for container runs.
  - `README.md` with run/test instructions and links to setup guides.
  - `docs/plan/SETUP_NGROK.md` for local webhook exposure and QA.
  - `requirements.txt`, `ruff.toml`, `.gitignore`.
- Tests
  - Health + WhatsApp webhook + WhatsApp client dry-run + agents_configured checks.

How to Run Locally
- One command: `make start` (creates venv, installs, runs on `:8080`).
- Health: `curl -s http://localhost:8080/healthz`
- Tests: `make test`
- Local webhook via HTTPS (ngrok): `make tunnel` then configure Meta as in `docs/plan/SETUP_NGROK.md`.

Acceptance Criteria Check
- Service boots without errors: Yes (local run via `make start`).
- `GET /healthz` returns 200 < 100ms: Endpoint implemented; performance acceptable in local tests.
- Local lint/test pass. CI pipeline planned for Phase 11.

Notes & Assumptions
- ADR-0001 (tech stack) remains Proposed; stakeholder sign-off pending.
- Redaction masks common email/phone patterns in logs; extend as needed.
- Build metadata `APP_VERSION` and `GIT_SHA` are read from env when present.

Next Steps (Phase 2+)
- Phase 2: WhatsApp inbound verified; wire outbound replies to flow; finalize sandbox delivery checks.
- Phase 3: Implement French NLU flow with session state and guardrails.
- Phase 4: Integrate Google Calendar for availability and booking.
