# Implementation Plan & Tracking

This folder contains the modular, phase-by-phase implementation plan and tracking artifacts derived from the functional requirements in `docs/ai_appointment_booking_assistant_functional_requirements_markdown.md`.

- Start at `docs/plan/ROADMAP.md` to see the full project phases.
- Use the per-phase files in `docs/plan/phases/` to track work with checkboxes.
- Keep high-level progress synced in `docs/plan/TODO.md`.
- Capture decisions in `docs/plan/DECISIONS.md` and risks in `docs/plan/RISKS.md`.
- System configuration and environment variables are documented in `docs/plan/CONFIG.md`.

Update guidance
- Update checkboxes as tasks progress.
- Add owners and due dates where relevant.
- When scope changes, add or adjust tasks (and link to the FRD section).
- Keep decisions and risks current to reflect reality.
